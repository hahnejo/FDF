Fils de fur

This project is one of the Ã‰cole 42's assignments.
In this project, it is possible to devise a program that takes a file that has sequences of numbers separated by space.
Each number in a file will refer to each coordinate in a grid.
Depending on the number's size, the program determines the height for that position, ultimately draws a height map.
